# Energy Flow Unified Training Issues Analysis

## Executive Summary

This unified report consolidates findings from both the detailed code analysis and the existing training issues report, providing a comprehensive view of the three critical training problems in the energy_flow project. The analysis reveals interconnected issues that require systematic resolution.

## Problem 1: GPU Memory Exhaustion on Second Batch

### Symptoms

- Training stops on batch 2 with CUDA OOM (28+ GB allocated)
- Memory fragmentation warnings from PyTorch allocator
- Expectation of memory cleanup between batches not met

### Root Cause Analysis (Unified View)

**Primary Issues:**

1. **Accumulating Computation Graphs** - Persistent references retain gradients across batches
2. **Batch Assembly on CUDA** - Default device="cuda" causes memory leaks between batches
3. **Inefficient Memory Cleanup** - `cleanup_memory_safe()` runs only every 8 steps (too infrequent)

**Secondary Issues:**

- Gradient accumulation retains graphs via `retain_graph=True`
- Storing large CUDA tensors in `self.*` keeps them alive
- Aggressive metric collection forces synchronizations
- Missing gradient detachment in persistent tensors

### Evidence from Code

- [`flow_processor.py:1184-1220`](energy_flow/core/flow_processor.py:1184) - cleanup runs every 8 steps
- [`energy_trainer.py:695`](energy_flow/training/energy_trainer.py:695) - backward pass fails due to accumulated graphs
- DataLoader shuffle generator device mismatch (now fixed but needs verification)

### Concrete Fixes (Prioritized)

**Immediate (Phase 1):**

```python
# 1. Increase cleanup frequency
self.memory_cleanup_interval = 2  # instead of 8

# 2. Add gradient detachment
def detach_persistent_tensors(self):
    if self.tensor_storage is not None:
        self.tensor_storage.positions = self.tensor_storage.positions.detach()
        self.tensor_storage.energies = self.tensor_storage.energies.detach()
        self.tensor_storage.hidden_states = self.tensor_storage.hidden_states.detach()

# 3. Keep tensors on CPU until needed
# In train_step: move embeddings to device only when required
```

**Memory Management:**

- Set `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` (Windows supported)
- Use `pin_memory=True` with CPU tensors in DataLoader
- Move `reset_peak_memory_stats()` to epoch boundaries
- Eliminate `retain_graph=True` in training paths

**Verification:**

- [ ] No OOM at original batch size
- [ ] Peak memory stabilizes across batches
- [ ] Memory usage doesn't grow monotonically

## Problem 2: Performance Degradation After First Batch

### Symptoms

- First batch runs fast; subsequent batches 2-5x slower
- GPU utilization drops after initial batch

### Root Cause Analysis (Unified View)

**Primary Issues:**

1. **CUDA Synchronization Overhead** - Frequent `torch.cuda.synchronize()` calls
2. **Memory Fragmentation** - Fragmented allocator after first batch
3. **Inefficient Logging** - `.item()` calls on CUDA tensors force syncs

**Secondary Issues:**

- DataLoader multiprocessing overhead on Windows
- Autocast/GradScaler warmup adding kernel compilation
- Missing tensor pooling for repeated operations

### Evidence from Code

- `torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()` called per-step
- DEBUG logging uses `.item()` on CUDA tensors
- No tensor pre-allocation for common operations

### Concrete Fixes (Prioritized)

**Immediate (Phase 1):**

```python
# 1. Rate-limit expensive metrics
gated_log(logger, 'INFO', step=step, key='flow_step_progress',
          msg_or_factory=..., every=10, first_n_steps=5)

# 2. Avoid .item() in hot loops
# Aggregate on GPU, move to CPU after detach()

# 3. Move memory stats to epoch boundaries
if epoch_boundary or DEBUG_MEMORY:
    torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()
```

**Performance Optimizations:**

- Tune DataLoader: `num_workers=2`, `persistent_workers=True`, `pin_memory=True`
- Pre-allocate tensor pools for common operations
- Use `torch.no_grad()` for validation and metrics
- Consider `torch.compile()` for stable training paths

**Verification:**

- [ ] Step time remains within 10-20% of batch 1
- [ ] GPU utilization stays steady
- [ ] No unnecessary synchronization points

## Problem 3: NaN Gradients in AddmmBackward0

### Symptoms

- `RuntimeError: Function 'AddmmBackward0' returned nan values`
- Warnings about missing forward pass info
- Occasional GRU OOM when GPU is saturated

### Root Cause Analysis (Unified View)

**Primary Issues:**

1. **Gradient Explosion in GRU** - Hidden states produce exploding gradients
2. **Numerical Instability** - Energy values become extremely large/small
3. **Missing Gradient Control** - No clipping before backward pass

**Secondary Issues:**

- High learning rate with insufficient clipping
- Mixed precision edge cases
- Unstable initialization of GRU weights

### Evidence from Code

- [`energy_trainer.py:695`](energy_flow/training/energy_trainer.py:695) - NaN in backward pass
- [`energy_carrier.py:273`](energy_flow/core/energy_carrier.py:273) - GRU forward pass
- Missing gradient clipping before `scaler.scale().backward()`

### Concrete Fixes (Prioritized)

**Immediate (Phase 1):**

```python
# 1. Add gradient clipping
def _apply_gradient_control(self):
    if self.scaler is not None:
        self.scaler.unscale_(self.optimizer)

    # Clip gradients
    torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(
        self.optimizer.param_groups[0]['params'],
        max_norm=0.1
    )

    # Check for NaN/Inf
    for param in self.optimizer.param_groups[0]['params']:
        if param.grad is not None:
            if not torch.isfinite(param.grad).all():
                param.grad = None
                return False
    return True

# 2. Reduce learning rate (already at 0.25x, consider 0.5x more)
# 3. Add finite checks on critical tensors
```

**Numerical Stability:**

- Clamp/layernorm inputs to GRU
- Add finite guards in debug mode
- Use `torch.nan_to_num` as stopgap when non-finites detected
- Consider disabling AMP temporarily to isolate issues

**Verification:**

- [ ] No NaNs with anomaly detection off after initial debug
- [ ] Loss curves remain finite and smooth
- [ ] Gradient norms bounded by clip threshold

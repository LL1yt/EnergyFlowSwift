# Configuration Guidelines

When creating or modifying configuration files (`.yaml`, `.json`, `.toml`), adhere to these principles in addition to the general project guidelines (@project-guidelines.mdc):

1. **Separation of Concerns**: 
   - Keep configuration separate from code.
   - Use YAML for human-readable configs, JSON for data exchange.
   - Group related settings together logically.

2. **Clear Structure**:
   - Use consistent naming conventions (snake_case for keys).
   - Include comments explaining non-obvious settings.
   - Organize settings hierarchically.

3. **Environment-Specific Configs**:
   - Support different configs for development/testing/production.
   - Use environment variables for sensitive information.
   - Provide reasonable defaults for all settings.

4. **Validation**:
   - Validate configuration at application startup.
   - Document required vs optional settings.
   - Provide clear error messages for invalid configs.

5. **Model/Training Configurations**:
   - Separate model architecture configs from training hyperparameters.
   - Include data path configurations.
   - Document GPU/memory requirements in config comments.

Example structure:
```yaml
# Model configuration
model:
  name: "gpt2-small"
  max_length: 512
  
# Training configuration  
training:
  batch_size: 8
  learning_rate: 2e-5
  epochs: 3
  
# Data configuration
data:
  train_path: "data/train.jsonl"
  val_path: "data/val.jsonl"
```

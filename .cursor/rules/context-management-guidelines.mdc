# Context Management Guidelines

## Overview
This rule enforces proper context management across LLM sessions to prevent loss of development progress and ensure seamless continuation of work.

## Core Requirements

### 1. MANDATORY Context Updates

**AT THE END OF EVERY SESSION** - Update `CONTEXT_SUMMARY.md` with:
- Current module being worked on
- Exact step where development stopped
- Last successful test/command
- Any current blockers or issues
- Next immediate action to take
- Updated progress percentages

### 2. Session Start Protocol

**AT THE START OF EVERY SESSION**:
1. Read `CONTEXT_SUMMARY.md` first
2. Verify current state matches documented state
3. Run basic integration tests if needed
4. Identify exact continuation point before proceeding

### 3. Critical Context Information

**Always document**:
- **Module location**: Exact path to current work
- **Implementation step**: Specific task in progress
- **Dependencies**: Status of required modules
- **Configuration changes**: Any new settings or files
- **Integration status**: Working/broken connections between modules
- **Test commands**: Commands that verify current functionality

### 4. Context File Structure

`CONTEXT_SUMMARY.md` must contain:
```markdown
## üìä –¢–ï–ö–£–©–ò–ô –°–¢–ê–¢–£–° –ü–†–û–ï–ö–¢–ê
- Date and progress percentage
- Current phase details

## ‚úÖ –ó–ê–í–ï–†–®–ï–ù–ù–´–ï –ú–û–î–£–õ–ò
- Complete module list with status
- API information for integration

## ‚è≥ –¢–ï–ö–£–©–ò–ô/–°–õ–ï–î–£–Æ–©–ò–ô –ú–û–î–£–õ–¨  
- Exact current work location
- Current implementation step
- Dependencies status

## üö® –ö–†–ò–¢–ò–ß–ï–°–ö–ò–ï –ü–†–û–ë–õ–ï–ú–´
- Active blockers
- Solution attempts
- Current status

## üéØ –î–û–°–¢–ò–ñ–ï–ù–ò–Ø –¢–ï–ö–£–©–ï–ô –°–ï–°–°–ò–ò
- What was accomplished
- New functionality added

## üéØ –ü–†–ò–û–†–ò–¢–ï–¢–´ –î–õ–Ø –°–õ–ï–î–£–Æ–©–ï–ô –°–ï–°–°–ò–ò
- Immediate next steps
- Continuation points
```

### 5. Context Validation Rules

**Before ending session**:
- [ ] All module `plan.md` files updated with progress
- [ ] Any errors documented in respective `errors.md` files  
- [ ] `CONTEXT_SUMMARY.md` reflects current state
- [ ] Clear "next action" documented
- [ ] Last working test confirmed

**When starting new session**:
- [ ] Context summary reviewed and validated
- [ ] Current state verified against documented state
- [ ] Any discrepancies noted and resolved
- [ ] Continuation point identified

### 6. Emergency Recovery Process

If context is unclear or lost:
1. Check `CONTEXT_SUMMARY.md` for last known state
2. Review recent `plan.md` updates across modules
3. Check `errors.md` files for recent issues
4. Test basic functionality to verify current state
5. Update context summary with findings
6. Document gaps for future prevention

## Integration with Existing Rules

This rule works alongside:
- `documentation-guidelines.mdc` - for keeping docs updated
- `project-guidelines.mdc` - for overall project structure
- Main `instructions.md` - for development principles

## Success Metrics

- Zero sessions start without clear context
- No repeated debugging of previously solved issues
- Seamless handoff between different LLM sessions
- Complete development history preservation

# Data Processing Guidelines

When creating or modifying data processing files (`.py`, data formats), adhere to these principles in addition to the general project guidelines (@project-guidelines.mdc):

1. **Data Validation**: 
   - Validate data format and structure at the beginning of processing.
   - Check for missing values, correct data types, expected ranges.
   - Log validation results with detailed information.

2. **Clear Data Flow**:
   - Document data transformations in comments and docstrings.
   - Use consistent data formats between modules.
   - Preserve data lineage (track where data comes from).

3. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - Process data in batches when dealing with large datasets.
   - Use generators for data streaming when possible.
   - Monitor memory usage, especially with large models.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle corrupt or malformed data gracefully.
   - Provide meaningful error messages for data issues.
   - Log data processing errors with context.

5. **Data Security**:
   - Never commit sensitive data to version control.
   - Use appropriate data anonymization techniques.
   - Document data privacy requirements.

6. **Reproducibility**:
   - Use random seeds for reproducible results.
   - Version control data processing scripts.
   - Document data sources and preprocessing steps.

7. **Integration with ML Pipeline**:
   - Ensure data formats are compatible with model expectations.
   - Implement proper train/validation/test splits.
   - Support data augmentation and preprocessing pipelines.

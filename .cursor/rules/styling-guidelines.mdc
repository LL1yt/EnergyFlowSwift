# CSS Specific Guidelines

When working on CSS files (`.css`), adhere to these principles in addition to the general project guidelines (@project-guidelines.mdc):

1.  **File Location**: 
    *   Place all CSS styles in separate `.css` files.
    *   Module-specific styles should reside within the module's `public/css/` directory (e.g., `module_name/public/css/styles.css`).
2.  **Separation of Concerns**: 
    *   Do NOT include styles directly (inline) in HTML files.
3.  **Naming Conventions**: 
    *   Follow a consistent naming convention for CSS classes and IDs to avoid conflicts between modules.
4.  **Integration**: 
    *   Module CSS files should be referenced directly in the main application's HTML (e.g., `app/public/index.html`) using a link tag pointing to the module's served path (e.g., `/modules/module_name/css/styles.css`). Refer to the module integration guidelines in @instructions.md or `app/module-integration-guide.md` if needed.
5.  **Documentation**: While CSS files themselves don't have the same documentation requirements as modules, ensure that any significant styling choices or complex selectors are understandable.

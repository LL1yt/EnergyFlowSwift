# Tensor Type Fix Summary

## Issue Found
The cache lookup was failing because `cell_idx` was being passed as a `torch.Tensor` object instead of an integer.

### Root Cause
In `gpu_spatial_processor.py`, the `cell_idx` comes from iterating over a tensor of indices, which yields tensor elements (0-dimensional tensors), not Python integers.

### Symptoms
- Cache loaded successfully with 1000 cells (keys 0-999 as integers)
- But lookup failed with warning: "Кэш не найден для клетки 544"
- Debug showed: `Looking for cell_idx: 544, type: <class 'torch.Tensor'>`
- Cache keys were integers, but lookup was using tensor objects

## Fix Applied

### gpu_spatial_processor.py (lines 831-839)
```python
# Before:
processed_state = processor_fn(
    cell_state,
    neighbor_states,
    cell_idx,           # Was passing tensor
    neighbor_indices    # Was passing tensor
)

# After:
processed_state = processor_fn(
    cell_state,
    neighbor_states,
    cell_idx.item() if isinstance(cell_idx, torch.Tensor) else cell_idx,
    neighbor_indices.tolist() if isinstance(neighbor_indices, torch.Tensor) else neighbor_indices
)
```

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
1. `cell_idx` is converted to Python int using `.item()`
2. `neighbor_indices` is converted to Python list using `.tolist()`
3. Cache lookups will now work correctly with integer keys
4. Connections will be properly classified into LOCAL/FUNCTIONAL/DISTANT categories

## Test Command
```bash
python test_neighbor_fix.py
```

## Expected Results
- No more "Кэш не найден для клетки X" warnings
- Proper classification showing non-zero connections for each expert
- Reasonable loss values (not zero)

# Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Only 1 Cell Being Processed
**Problem**: Lattice was processing "1 cells" instead of 1000
**Cause**: Shape mismatch - embedding trainer was passing `[batch, total_cells, state_size]` but lattice expected `[total_cells, state_size]`
**Fix**: Modified embedding_trainer.py to remove batch dimension when setting lattice states

### 2. ✅ Cache Not Finding Entries
**Problem**: Cache was loaded but returning empty results for cells
**Cause**: Connection classifier was converting global indices to local indices but cache expected global indices
**Fix**: Modified connection_classifier.py to pass global neighbor indices directly to cache

### 3. ✅ Too Many Neighbors
**Problem**: 
- First had 999 neighbors (all cells except current)
- Then had 511 neighbors (still too many)
**Cause**: Adaptive radius ratio was too high (0.6, then 0.3)
**Fix**: Reduced adaptive_radius_ratio to 0.15 in DebugPreset

### 4. ✅ Shape Mismatch
**Problem**: Multiple shape mismatches between components
**Fix**: 
- Fixed lattice state setting/getting to handle batch dimension properly
- Added unsqueeze(0) when getting states back from lattice

## Configuration Changes

### config_components.py - DebugPreset
```python
lattice_adaptive_radius_ratio: float = 0.15  # Reduced from 0.6 → 0.3 → 0.15
```

### simple_config.py - _apply_debug_mode()
```python
# Added to apply the debug preset's adaptive radius
if hasattr(preset, 'lattice_adaptive_radius_ratio'):
    self.lattice.adaptive_radius_ratio = preset.lattice_adaptive_radius_ratio
```

## Expected Results

With adaptive radius of 1.5 (15% of 10):
- Each cell should have ~20-50 neighbors
- Connections should be properly classified as LOCAL/FUNCTIONAL/DISTANT
- Full lattice of 1000 cells should be processed
- Cache should be regenerated with correct parameters

## Test Command
```bash
python test_neighbor_fix.py

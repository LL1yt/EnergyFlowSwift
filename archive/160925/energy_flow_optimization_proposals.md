# Energy Flow Optimization Proposals

## 1. Vectorize Flow Collection Operations

### Current Problem (energy_lattice.py:850-853)

```python
# Inefficient Python list comprehension
completed_flows = [
    flow for flow in self.active_flows.values()
    if not flow.is_active and flow.projected_surface != "unknown"
]
```

### Proposed Solution

```python
# Vectorized approach using tensor operations
# If using tensorized storage:
if self.tensor_storage is not None:
    completed_mask = self.tensor_storage.is_completed & (self.tensor_storage.projected_surface != 0)
    completed_indices = torch.where(completed_mask)[0]
    # Process all completed flows in a single operation
else:
    # For non-tensorized storage, still minimize Python loops
    completed_flow_ids = [fid for fid, flow in self.active_flows.items()
                         if not flow.is_active and flow.projected_surface != "unknown"]
    # Batch process in chunks rather than individual operations
```

### Current Problem (energy_lattice.py:872-875)

```python
# Inefficient grouping with Python loops
grouped_flows = {}
for flow in completed_flows:
    key = self.get_normalized_buffer_key(flow.position)
    grouped_flows.setdefault(key, []).append(flow)
```

### Proposed Solution

```python
# Vectorized grouping using tensor operations
if self.tensor_storage is not None:
    # Use tensor operations for grouping
    positions = self.tensor_storage.positions[completed_indices]
    # Vectorized coordinate quantization
    idx_x = (((positions[:, 0] + 1) * 0.5) * (self.width - 1)).round().clamp(0, self.width - 1).long()
    idx_y = (((positions[:, 1] + 1) * 0.5) * (self.height - 1)).round().clamp(0, self.height - 1).long()
    surface_idx = idx_y * self.width + idx_x
    # Group using torch.unique
    unique_indices, inverse_indices = torch.unique(surface_idx, return_inverse=True)
else:
    # Minimize Python loops by pre-sorting
    completed_flows_sorted = sorted(completed_flows, key=lambda f: self.get_normalized_buffer_key(f.position))
    # Group in a single pass
    grouped_flows = {}
    current_key = None
    current_group = []
    for flow in completed_flows_sorted:
        key = self.get_normalized_buffer_key(flow.position)
        if key != current_key:
            if current_group:
                grouped_flows[current_key] = current_group
            current_key = key
            current_group = [flow]
        else:
            current_group.append(flow)
    if current_group:
        grouped_flows[current_key] = current_group
```

## 2. Optimize Memory Management

### Current Problem (flow_processor.py:1144-1150)

```python
# Inefficient individual flow deletion
completed_ids = [fid for fid, flow in self.lattice.active_flows.items()
                if not flow.is_active]
if completed_ids:
    for fid in completed_ids:
        del self.lattice.active_flows[fid]
```

### Proposed Solution

```python
# Batch deletion
completed_ids = [fid for fid, flow in self.lattice.active_flows.items()
                if not flow.is_active]
if completed_ids:
    # Delete all at once
    for fid in completed_ids:
        self.lattice.active_flows.pop(fid, None)  # Use pop with default to avoid KeyError
    # Or even better, recreate the dictionary without completed flows
    # self.lattice.active_flows = {fid: flow for fid, flow in self.lattice.active_flows.items()
    #                             if flow.is_active}
```

### Current Problem (flow_processor.py:1159-1164)

```python
# Excessive GPU memory operations
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
try:
    torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()
except Exception as e:
    logger.debug(f"reset_peak_memory_stats not available or failed: {e}")
```

### Proposed Solution

```python
# Conditional and less frequent cleanup
if self.step_counter % (self.memory_cleanup_interval * 2) == 0:  # Less frequent
    mem_allocated = torch.cuda.memory_allocated() / 1e9
    mem_reserved = torch.cuda.memory_reserved() / 1e9

    # Only cleanup if memory usage is significantly high
    if mem_allocated > self.memory_threshold_gb * 1.5:
        torch.cuda.empty_cache()
        try:
            torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()
        except Exception:
            pass
```

## 3. Improve Aggregation Logic

### Current Problem (energy_lattice.py:894-904)

```python
# Inefficient nested operations
energies_tensor = torch.stack([f.energy for f in flows])
energy_magnitudes = torch.norm(energies_tensor, dim=-1)
distances_to_surface = torch.tensor([f.distance_to_surface for f in flows], device=self.device)
steps_taken = torch.tensor([f.steps_taken for f in flows], device=self.device, dtype=torch.float32)
proximity = 1.0 / (1.0 + distances_to_surface)
steps_factor = 1.0 + steps_taken * 0.1
weights = torch.softmax(energy_magnitudes * proximity * steps_factor, dim=0)
aggregated_energy = (energies_tensor * weights.unsqueeze(-1)).sum(dim=0)
```

### Proposed Solution

```python
# Pre-allocate tensors and use vectorized operations
batch_size = len(flows)
if batch_size > 1:
    # Pre-allocate tensors
    energies_tensor = torch.stack([f.energy for f in flows])
    # Vectorized distance calculation (if available in flow objects)
    distances_tensor = torch.tensor([f.distance_to_surface for f in flows], device=self.device)
    steps_tensor = torch.tensor([f.steps_taken for f in flows], device=self.device, dtype=torch.float32)

    # Vectorized weight calculation
    energy_magnitudes = torch.norm(energies_tensor, dim=-1)
    proximity_factors = 1.0 / (1.0 + distances_tensor)
    steps_factors = 1.0 + steps_tensor * 0.1
    weights_raw = energy_magnitudes * proximity_factors * steps_factors
    weights = torch.softmax(weights_raw, dim=0)

    # Vectorized aggregation
    aggregated_energy = (energies_tensor * weights.unsqueeze(-1)).sum(dim=0)
else:
    # Single flow case
    aggregated_energy = flows[0].energy
```

## 4. Optimize Cleanup Operations

### Current Problem (flow_processor.py:1131-1174)

```python
# Inefficient periodic cleanup
def cleanup_memory_safe(self):
    self.step_counter += 1

    # Check interval every step
    if self.step_counter % self.memory_cleanup_interval != 0:
        return

    # Python loop for flow deletion
    completed_ids = [fid for fid, flow in self.lattice.active_flows.items()
                    if not flow.is_active]

    if completed_ids:
        for fid in completed_ids:
            del self.lattice.active_flows[fid]

    # Frequent GPU memory operations
    if self.device.type == 'cuda':
        mem_allocated = torch.cuda.memory_allocated() / 1e9
        mem_reserved = torch.cuda.memory_reserved() / 1e9

        if mem_allocated > self.memory_threshold_gb:
            torch.cuda.empty_cache()
            try:
                torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()
            except Exception as e:
                logger.debug(f"reset_peak_memory_stats not available or failed: {e}")
```

### Proposed Solution

```python
def cleanup_memory_safe(self):
    self.step_counter += 1

    # Less frequent cleanup
    if self.step_counter % (self.memory_cleanup_interval * 2) != 0:
        return

    # Batch flow cleanup
    completed_flows = [(fid, flow) for fid, flow in self.lattice.active_flows.items()
                      if not flow.is_active]

    if completed_flows:
        completed_ids = [fid for fid, _ in completed_flows]
        # Batch deletion
        for fid in completed_ids:
            self.lattice.active_flows.pop(fid, None)
        logger.debug(f"ðŸ§¹ Cleaned {len(completed_ids)} completed flows")

    # Conditional GPU memory operations
    if self.device.type == 'cuda':
        # Only check memory every N cleanup cycles
        if self.step_counter % (self.memory_cleanup_interval * 4) == 0:
            mem_allocated = torch.cuda.memory_allocated() / 1e9
            mem_reserved = torch.cuda.memory_reserved() / 1e9

            # Higher threshold to reduce frequency
            if mem_allocated > self.memory_threshold_gb * 1.2:
                # Asynchronous cleanup if possible
                torch.cuda.empty_cache()
                try:
                    torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()
                except Exception:
                    pass

                mem_allocated_after = torch.cuda.memory_allocated() / 1e9
                mem_freed = mem_allocated - mem_allocated_after

                if mem_freed > 0.1:  # Only log significant cleanup
                    logger.info(f"ðŸ§¹ GPU memory cleanup: freed {mem_freed:.2f}GB")
```

## 5. Implement Efficient Data Structures

### Current Problem (energy_lattice.py: Multiple locations)

```python
# Inefficient data access patterns
# Using Python dictionaries for flow storage
# Repeated position calculations
```

### Proposed Solution

```python
# Implement spatial hashing for efficient flow access
class SpatialHashTable:
    def __init__(self, grid_size, dimensions=3):
        self.grid_size = grid_size
        self.dimensions = dimensions
        self.grid = {}  # Hash table: grid_key -> list of flow_ids

    def _get_grid_key(self, position):
        """Convert normalized position to grid key"""
        # Quantize position to grid
        grid_coords = ((position + 1) * 0.5 * (self.grid_size - 1)).long()
        return tuple(grid_coords.cpu().numpy())

    def insert_flow(self, flow_id, position):
        """Insert flow into spatial hash table"""
        key = self._get_grid_key(position)
        if key not in self.grid:
            self.grid[key] = []
        self.grid[key].append(flow_id)

    def get_nearby_flows(self, position, radius=1):
        """Get flows in nearby grid cells"""
        center_key = self._get_grid_key(position)
        nearby_flows = []

        # Check neighboring cells
        for dx in range(-radius, radius + 1):
            for dy in range(-radius, radius + 1):
                for dz in range(-radius, radius + 1):
                    neighbor_key = (center_key[0] + dx, center_key[1] + dy, center_key[2] + dz)
                    if neighbor_key in self.grid:
                        nearby_flows.extend(self.grid[neighbor_key])

        return nearby_flows

# Use in EnergyLattice
class EnergyLattice(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config=None):
        # ... existing code ...
        self.spatial_hash = SpatialHashTable(grid_size=max(self.width, self.height, self.depth))

    def batch_update_flows(self, flow_ids, positions, energies, hidden_states):
        """Update flows with spatial hashing"""
        # ... existing code ...

        # Update spatial hash
        for i, flow_id in enumerate(flow_ids):
            flow_id_item = flow_id.item()
            if flow_id_item in self.active_flows:
                # Update spatial hash
                self.spatial_hash.insert_flow(flow_id_item, positions[i])
```

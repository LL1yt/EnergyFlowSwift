# 3D Cellular Neural Network - Session Context

**Last Updated:** December 5, 2025  
**Current Session Status:** 🎉 **PHASE 2 DAY 1 COMPLETED!**

---

## 🎯 WHERE WE ARE NOW

### ✅ Phase 1 - COMPLETED (100%)

**Core foundation modules working:**

- `core/cell_prototype/` - Neural cell implementation ✅
- `core/lattice_3d/` - 3D grid structure ✅
- `core/signal_propagation/` - Temporal dynamics ✅

**Key achievement:** Full end-to-end signal propagation through 3D lattice is working and tested.

### 🚀 Phase 2 - IN PROGRESS (Day 1 Complete!)

**Status:** `data/embedding_loader/` module - ✅ **ALL TESTS PASSED!**  
**Achievement:** Complete working embedding loader with 3 format support  
**Next modules to build:**

- `data/embedding_loader/` - ✅ **DAY 1 COMPLETED** (Basic functionality working!)
- `data/tokenizer/` - ⏳ Next priority (Phase 2.2)
- `data/data_visualization/` - ⏳ Following (Phase 2.3)

## 🎯 NEXT SESSION ACTIONS

### 🔥 IMMEDIATE PRIORITY (Day 2)

**Module:** `data/embedding_loader/` - Continue development  
**Focus:** Optimization, error handling, configuration integration  
**Goal:** Complete Day 2 tasks from PHASE_2_PLAN.md  
**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours for optimization features

### 📋 Step-by-Step Plan (Day 2)

## ⚙️ TECHNICAL CONTEXT

### 🛠️ Current Working Setup

- **Python Environment:** `.venv/` (all dependencies installed)
- **GPU Status:** RTX 5090 requires `gpu_enabled=False`
- **Testing:** All Phase 1 modules pass tests
- **Config:** YAML-based configuration system working

### 📦 Dependencies for Phase 2

**Need to add to requirements.txt:**

```
transformers>=4.21.0    # For BERT/GPT tokenizers
gensim>=4.2.0          # For Word2Vec loading
plotly>=5.0.0          # For 3D visualization
```

## 🐛 CRITICAL NOTES

### ⚠️ Known Issues

- **GPU:** RTX 5090 PyTorch compatibility issue (use CPU mode)
- **Memory:** O(N³) scaling with lattice size - test with small lattices first
- **Integration:** Always test new modules with Phase 1 core modules

### ✅ What's Working Well

- Module structure and documentation pattern established
- YAML configuration system
- Integration between core modules
- Testing infrastructure

# Session Summary — 2025-10-07

Scope: stabilize FP16 GPU path for TCN/TextBridge, eliminate invalid device loads, and extend fused MPSGraph caches for static-shape execution. All changes target EnergyFlowSwift Phase 8 (Optimization under Metal/GPU) while preserving the minimal, research-first code path (no fallbacks).

## Implemented in this session

- Fused MPSGraph executable caches for static shapes

  - LNGeLUGemmCache: builds and caches LayerNorm → GELU → MatMul(+bias) executables per fixed-shape key; reuses cached MPSNDArray inputs/outputs for zero-alloc hot-path execution.
  - GeLUGemmCache: GELU → MatMul(+bias), integrated into TCN block forward where applicable (notably for conv2 with kernelSize=1 pre-pack path).
  - Static shapes (fixed B, L_max, D, etc.) enforced to maximize cache reuse and minimize graph recompilation.

- Weight prepacking and caching

  - GraphConv1D: cached repacked 2D weights for kernelSize=1 inside GraphConv1D with cache invalidation on reset.
  - Reuse of cached MTLBuffers for FP16 weights and intermediate tensors where shapes are invariant.

- GPU memory alignment fixes (critical)

  - GraphLinear (FP16) buffers now packed row-wise with aligned rowBytes (multiple of 16 bytes) and stride-aware copy helpers for host↔device transfers. Matrix descriptors use the same aligned rowBytes.
  - GraphConv1D (FP16, im2col + GEMM) updated to allocate Xcol/Wcol/Y with aligned rowBytes (chosen 64B alignment), pack rows with stride, and construct MPSMatrixDescriptor with those aligned strides.
  - These fixes resolve “Invalid device load … mmul_kernel_a16_float_float_float” errors caused by misaligned rowBytes/strides.

- Integration into TCN forward
  - TCN forward path prefers the fused/cached GPU route over CPU LN/GELU implementations to reduce CPU pressure and GPU graph rebuilds.

## Test and status notes

- Prior to fixes, CombinedABAlternationTests reported CE not decreasing and emitted GPU invalid device load errors during matmul.
- After alignment and packing fixes in GraphLinear and GraphConv1D, tests ran and appear to pass (“вроде тесты прошли успешно”).
- FP16 numerical tolerance retained; debug logs confirm GraphLinear forward completion on FP16 fast path.

## Design and constraints honored

- Static-shape caches with fixed maxLength/config ensure executable reuse.
- No fallback paths in hot execution (research mode). CPU ops remain for reference/debug, but the primary path is GPU.
- Straightforward, modular implementations consistent with project rules; centralized buffer handling and logging.

## Known limitations / open items

- Bias addition in some paths is still on CPU (post-matmul). Can be moved into GPU graph for completeness.
- Backward pass coverage: GraphLinear has GPU dW and dX paths; fused block backward is not yet implemented (rely on MPSGraph autodiff or extend fused caches to backward).
- Memory pool/heap not fully leveraged; current BufferPool uses shared buffers but not MTLHeap/private storage.

## Next steps aligned with docs/roadmap_swift_mps.md (focus on Phase 8)

1. Offload standalone LayerNorm to GPU with caching

   - Implement LNExecCache with fixed-shape keys and cached MPSNDArray bindings.
   - Integrate into TCNBlock.forward to remove remaining CPU LN.

2. Complete/fuse bias on GPU

   - Fold bias addition into the matmul result in the fused graphs (both GeLUGemm and LNGeLUGemm variants) to reduce host work.

3. Extend training support on GPU

   - Ensure robust backward for GraphConv1D and fused blocks (via MPSGraph autodiff or explicit matrix multiplications), respecting FP16 + master FP32.
   - Introduce dynamic loss scaling for mixed precision stability.

4. Buffer lifetime and pooling

   - Introduce MTLHeap-backed buffer pool for persistent X/Y/W buffers with aligned rowBytes; prefer private storage for weights.
   - Continue zeroing only when required; keep shape-stable buffers across steps.

5. Validation and tests

   - Add unit tests for stride-aligned copy helpers and descriptor construction (GraphLinear, GraphConv1D).
   - Re-run CombinedABAlternationTests and DecoderTrainerMiniStepTests over multiple seeds to confirm CE decreases reliably.

6. Profiling and benchmarks

   - GPU counters/frame capture to quantify graph cache reuse and memory bandwidth.

7. Toward Phase 5–7 milestones (incremental)
   - Mode A/B alternating training loop stability checks and metric logging (Phase 5/6).
   - Prepare FP16 weight serialization and a minimal infer API stub (Phase 7) once the forward path is fully GPU-offloaded.

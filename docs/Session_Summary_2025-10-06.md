# EnergyFlowSwift — Session Summary (2025-10-06)

This session focused on training plumbing, centralized configuration, log polish, and partial GPU acceleration of the last TCN block’s backward pass. We also added small, focused tests to guard behavior and speed improvements.

## Highlights

- Centralized config for EFTrain
  - Removed CLI flags and ENV overrides. EFTrain now takes a single JSON config path (positional arg). Default: `Configs/train_debug.json`.
  - Introduced `ResolvedTrainConfig` in EFTrain; all training knobs come from JSON with clear defaults.
  - Reduced duplication with `TextToCubeEncoderConfig` by setting only fields that differ (e.g., `maxLength` and `outputDim`).

- Training loop improvements (kept from previous step, integrated cleanly)
  - LR warmup + cosine decay via `LRSchedulers.warmupCosine`.
  - Global L2 gradient clipping via `GradClip.clipGlobalL2Norm`.
  - Optimizer state save/load for projection-only (`AdamW.saveState/loadState`).

- Encoder gradient wiring
  - Added projection input gradients (GPU): `dX = dY @ W` for GraphLinear and connected it in EFTrain.
  - Added masked-mean backward with correct mask padding/truncation (fixed crash on ragged masks).
  - Unfreezing path: enabled partial training of the last TCN block with caches.

- Last TCN block backward (progressively GPU-accelerated)
  - Conv2 backward: GPU via `GraphLinear` on flattened `[B*L, H]` (done earlier in session).
  - Conv1 backward (this session): GPU GEMM with CPU im2col/col2im
    - CPU im2col: build `Xcol [B*L, Cin*K]` with dilation + causal padding.
    - GPU GEMM: `dW1col = dY^T @ Xcol`, `dXcol = dY @ Wcol` via `GraphLinear`.
    - CPU col2im: scatter `dXcol` back to `[B,L,Cin]`.
    - LayerNorm backward: CPU.
  - Net effect: heavy matmuls (conv1/conv2) are now on GPU; only cheap indexing ops remain on CPU. Noticeably faster steps.

- Log polish
  - Demoted verbose GraphLinear forward logs and per-chunk/post-update logs from `info` to `debug`.
  - At `info`: epoch boundaries, epoch summary, validation, checkpoint/opt-state saves.

## Code structure (new/updated files)

- EFTrain orchestration (refactor):
  - `Sources/EFTrain/main.swift` — slimmer main loop, no CLI flags/ENV, uses JSON config.
  - `Sources/EFTrain/OptimStep.swift` — builds params/grads, scales/clips, calls AdamW.step, writes back to encoder.
  - `Sources/EFTrain/Evaluation.swift` — evaluation helpers.
  - `Sources/EFTrain/MaskUtils.swift` — mask pad/truncate helper.
  - `Sources/EFTrain/CheckpointIO.swift` — projection-only checkpoint I/O.

- Training/backward helpers:
  - `Sources/EnergyFlow/Training/LastTCNBackward.swift` — reusable backward for last block
    - Conv2 backward (GPU), GELU (CPU), Conv1 backward (GPU GEMM + CPU im2col/col2im), LN backward (CPU).
  - `Sources/EFCore/Training/Conv1DGrad.swift` — CPU reference conv1 backward retained (still useful for comparisons).

- Tests:
  - `Tests/EnergyFlowSwiftTests/LastTCNBackwardMiniStepTests.swift` — one-step loss decrease with last-block unfreeze.
  - `Tests/EnergyFlowSwiftTests/EFTrainMiniEpochTests.swift` — tiny config + one mini-epoch, checks loss decreases.

## How to run

- Build/tests:
```bash
swift build
swift test -c debug
```

- Train (config-only, no flags):
```bash
swift run EFTrain -- Configs/train_debug.json
# or simply
swift run EFTrain --
# (defaults to Configs/train_debug.json)
```

- Toggle last TCN unfreeze in JSON:
```json
{
  "unfreezeLastTCN": true
}
```

## Observed behavior (sanity)

- With projection-only training, cosine improves quickly; MSE decreases more slowly (as expected with KD loss αcos + βmse).
- With last-block unfreeze enabled, both token-mode and text-mode paths are symmetric and stable; conv2+conv1 matmuls on GPU yield noticeable speed-up.
- Debug logs show dEnc norms and opt step LR; info-level summarizes epoch and validation.

## Next session: GPU col2im/im2col

Priority: move im2col/col2im to GPU to remove remaining CPU loops in conv1 backward.

Plan:
1) GPU im2col (X → Xcol) for causal, dilated 1D convolution
   - Choose representation `[B*L, Cin*K]` to match existing GEMM path.
   - Implement via MPSGraph or custom Metal kernel; ensure padding/dilation correctness.
2) GPU col2im (dXcol → dX) for backward scatter
   - Mirror indexing; optimize for memory coalescing.
3) Validation
   - Parity tests vs current CPU im2col/col2im on small shapes.
   - Micro-benchmark: measure time per backward step before/after.
4) Integration
   - Replace CPU im2col/col2im in `LastTCNBackward.swift` with GPU variants behind a flag (fallback to CPU for debug if needed).

Stretch goals (post-GPU col2im/im2col):
- Reuse/capture MPSGraph executables for static shapes (B, L, K) to avoid rebuild overhead.
- Add `logEvery` to config to control per-chunk logging frequency.
- Extend checkpoints to include last-block params/opt-state (versioned format) once training scope expands beyond projection.

---

This summary captures the main changes and the immediate next step. We’ll start the next session by implementing GPU im2col/col2im for the last TCN block’s backward pass and validating speed/accuracy.

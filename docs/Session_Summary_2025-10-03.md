# EnergyFlowSwift — Session Summary (2025-10-03)

This document summarizes the changes implemented in this session and proposes next steps aligned with docs/roadmap_swift_mps.md.

## What we implemented

- TextBridge and TCN-only encoder path
  - Removed legacy Transformer/Attention code paths to simplify build and follow the TCN-first plan.
  - Stripped leftover positional-encoding code from TextToCubeEncoder.
  - Kept TextToCubeEncoder focused on: Embedding → TCN → masked mean → GPU projection (GraphLinear).

- GPU projection and conv
  - GraphLinear (FP16, GPU): forward via MPSMatrixMultiplication; added cache invalidation for FP16 weights/bias.
  - GraphConv1D (FP16, GPU): causal 1D via im2col + GEMM; cached repacked FP16 weights; used in TCN for conv1/conv2.

- Losses, metrics, optimizer (Swift)
  - Added EFCore/Losses: row-wise cosine and MSE with per-example and mean.
  - Added EFCore/Optim/AdamW (skeleton, CPU) to update tensors given external grads.
  - Added gradient helpers:
    - dY_MSEMean, dY_CosineMeanLoss (for 1 − mean cosine), gradsGraphLinear (CPU ref).

- EFTextEval improvements
  - Default --micro-batch set to 32 for better GPU utilization by making matmuls fatter.
  - Logs both MSE and cosine for chunks; final average MSE remains reported.

- EFTrain CLI (new executable) and training loop
  - Added EFTrain executable with:
    - Text-mode support (no tokens in dataset): EFTrain tokenizes with our Swift tokenizer internally.
    - Token-mode support (pre-tokenized datasets) remains working.
    - KD loss combination: L = α·(1−cos) + β·MSE (cosine gradient added).
    - Projection-only training: updates only GraphLinear (projection) for now.
    - GPU gradients for GraphLinear: dW = dY^T·X via MPSMatrixMultiplication; dB on CPU.
    - Gradient accumulation (--accum-steps), post-update metrics on the same pooled activations.
    - Validation split (--val-fraction), epoch-end evaluation, checkpoint save/load for projection weights only.
    - Default --micro-batch 32.

- Tests
  - GraphConv1DParityTests: GPU vs CPU parity within relaxed FP16 tolerance.
  - GraphLinearTrainingStepTests: reduced LR for stable single-step MSE drop.
  - CosineGradTests: gradient for (1 − mean cosine) reduces loss in a small step.
  - Existing TCN smoke tests and TextToCube encoder shape tests pass.

- Housekeeping
  - Cleaned warnings (unused vars) in Conv1D/Lexer; minimized noisy logging; ensured tokenizer state is not copied by value in TextToCubeEncoder.encode().

## How to run (quick reference)

- Evaluate
  - From package dir (EnergyFlowSwift/EnergyFlowSwift):
    - EFTextEval --data ../data/your_dataset.jsonl|.efb --batch-size 32 --max-length 128 --micro-batch 32 --max-batches 2

- Train (text-mode, tokenizer in Swift)
  - EFTrain --data ../data/snli_text.jsonl --epochs 2 --batch-size 32 --max-length 128 --alpha-cos 1.0 --beta-mse 0.5 --micro-batch 32 --val-fraction 0.1 --save-checkpoint Checkpoints/proj_best.bin

- Train (token-mode)
  - EFTrain --data ../data/snli_tokens.efb --epochs 2 --batch-size 32 --max-length 128 --alpha-cos 1.0 --beta-mse 0.5 --micro-batch 32 --val-fraction 0.1 --save-checkpoint Checkpoints/proj_best.bin

- Checkpoint behavior (projection-only)
  - Save: If --save-checkpoint is provided, EFTrain saves when validation cosine improves.
  - Load: Provide --load-checkpoint path to initialize projection weights at startup (shapes must match).

- SwiftPM arg separator reminder
  - When running via swift run, put -- before EFTrain/EFTextEval flags:
    - swift run EFTrain -- --data ...

## Observations (SNLI 2k sanity)

- Cosine improves quickly under projection-only training (e.g., from ~0 to ~0.7–0.8 across a few chunks), MSE moves more slowly (as expected with αcos > 0).
- With micro-batch 32 (or higher), we see larger GEMM workloads on GPU; CPU still does embedding/TCN, im2col packing, pooling.
- Instruments (Metal System Trace + Time Profiler) recommended for profiling.

## Next steps (aligned with roadmap_swift_mps.md)

Short-term (Phase 2–3: encoder training)
- Autodiff/MPSGraph integration
  - Transition projection grad from our custom matmul to MPSGraph-based backward (optional), then extend to Conv1D (TCN) so we can train TCN blocks (dim/hid/k/dil). Start with 1–2 blocks to validate.
- Train more layers
  - Add gradients for Embedding and LayerNorm, or begin by unfreezing last TCN block only (progressive unfreeze), followed by projection.
- Training loop polish
  - LR warmup (e.g., 500–1k steps) and optional cosine decay; gradient clipping; improved logging.
  - Extend checkpoints to include optimizer state (m, v) for exact resume (optional).
- Data and tokenizer
  - Keep datasets unnormalized for now (teacher raw vectors) while combining cosine+MSE.
  - Add save/load for tokenizer vocabulary later for reproducibility; for now dynamic is fine.

Mid-term (Phase 4: decoder) — once encoder KD is stable
- Implement small autoregressive TCN-based decoder (z→tokens) with FiLM conditioning on z.
- Teacher-forcing training using pairs (text, z_teacher) followed by (text, z_student).
- Add CE loss and basic label smoothing.

Validation and metrics (Phase 6)
- Add robust validation metrics beyond batch averages:
  - Cosine(z_s, z_t) distribution; retrieval tests; text semantic similarity via teacher.
  - Track best checkpoints by cosine and by downstream metrics.

Optimization (Phase 8)
- Make forms more static (B, L_max) and reuse MPSGraph executables.
- Buffer pooling for intermediate tensors; reduce host/device copies.
- Explore FP16 master weights once stability proven; consider loss scaling.

Engineering and DX
- Add integration tests for EFTrain: mini-epoch on tiny synthetic set asserts loss improvement.
- Add friendly startup error messages for invalid dataset paths or shape mismatches.
- Optional: command to export/import projection weights as JSON/CSV for quick inspections.

## Open items / notes
- Some benign warnings remain (e.g., unused locals in TextCubeTokenizer). We can clean these as we touch those files.
- Projection-only checkpoints are small and fast; when we start training TCN and Embedding, we’ll version the checkpoint format and include affected parameters.
- For profiling, prefer Xcode Instruments (Metal System Trace + Time Profiler) to pinpoint CPU vs GPU hotspots.
